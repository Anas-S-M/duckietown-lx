# **Learning Experience (LX): DD21 UKF**

# About these activities

In this learning experience you will learn how to filter the raw measurements you get from the Duckiedrone's sensors.

This learning experience is provided by the Duckietown team and can be run on Duckiebots. Visit us at the 
[Duckietown Website](https://www.duckietown.com) for more learning materials, documentation, and demos.

For guided setup instructions, lecture content, and more related to this LX, see **TODO: Add course link here**.

# Activity theory part

Before you start working through this activity, you should read through the following sections:

- [Background](./notebooks/00-theory/00-overview.md)
- [The Unscented Kalman Filter](./notebooks/00-theory/01-UKF-theory.md)
- [Design and implementation steps](./notebooks/00-theory/02-UKF-implementation.md)

# Instructions

**NOTE:** All commands below are intended to be executed from the root directory of this exercise (i.e., the directory containing this README).


## 1. Make sure your exercise is up-to-date

Update your exercise definition and instructions,

    git pull upstream duckiedrone-lxs

**NOTE:** Example instructions to fork a repository and configure to pull from upstream can be found in the [duckietown-lx repository README](https://github.com/duckietown/duckietown-lx/blob/mooc2022/README.md).

## 2. Make sure your system is up-to-date

- ðŸ’» Always make sure your Duckietown Shell is updated to the latest version. See [installation instructions](https://github.com/duckietown/duckietown-shell)

- ðŸ’» Update the shell commands: `dts update`

- ðŸ’» Update your laptop/desktop: `dts desktop update`

- ðŸš™ Update your Duckiebot: `dts duckiebot update ROBOTNAME` (where `ROBOTNAME` is the name of your Duckiebot chosen during the initialization procedure.)

## 3. Work on the exercise

### Launch the code editor

Open the code editor by running the following command,

    dts code editor

Wait for a URL to appear on the terminal, then click on it or copy-paste it in the address bar
of your browser to access the code editor. The first thing you will see in the code editor is
this same document, you can continue there.

### Walkthrough of notebooks

**NOTE**: You should be reading this from inside the code editor in your browser.

Inside the code editor, use the navigator sidebar on the left-hand side to navigate to the
`notebooks` directory and open the first notebook.

Follow the instructions on the notebook and work through the notebooks in sequence.

### ðŸ’» Testing in simulation

To test in simulation, use the command

    dts code workbench --sim

There will be two URLs popping up to open in your browser: one is the direct view of the
simulated environment. The other is VNC and only useful for some exercises, follow the instructions
in the notebooks to see if you need to access VNC.

This simulation test is just that, a test. Don't trust it fully.

## Hand-in

Use this [link](https://classroom.github.com/a/9CaMl5yD) to generate a Github repo for this project. Clone the directory to your computer `git clone https://github.com/h2r/project-ukf-2020-yourGithubName.git`.

Commit and push your changes before the assignment is due. This will allow us to access the files you pushed to Github and grade them accordingly. If you commit and push after the assignment deadline, we will use your latest commit as your final submission, and you will be marked late.

    ```bash
    cd project-ukf-2020-yourGithubName
    git add -A
    git commit -a -m 'some commit message. maybe handin, maybe update'
    git push
    ```

Note that assignments will be graded anonymously, so please don't put your name or any other identifying information on the files you hand in.

## Troubleshooting


If an error of this form occurs

```bash
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/duckietown_challenges_cli/cli.py", line 76, in dt_challenges_cli_main
    dt_challenges_cli_main_(args=args, sections=sections, main_cmd="challenges")
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/duckietown_challenges_cli/cli.py", line 203, in dt_challenges_cli_main_
    f(rest, environment)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/duckietown_challenges_cli/cli_submit.py", line 165, in dt_challenges_cli_submit
    br = submission_build(

    raise ZException(msg, available=list(credentials))
zuper_commons.types.exceptions.ZException: Credentials for registry docker.io not available

```

you need to log into docker using `dts`. Use this command:

    dts challenges config --docker-username <USERNAME> --docker-password <PASSWORD>
