    "# Networking\n",
    "\n",
    "The learning objectives of this section are to familiarize you with\n",
    "how a TCP/IP server works and how to explore a network to find what\n",
    "computers (and robots!) are around, and then how to connect to them.\n",
    "We will use tools at a lower level than the robot programming\n",
    "interface you will use in the rest of the learning experiences, in order to focus on\n",
    "the general networking ideas. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Netcat\n",
    "\n",
    "The command `nc` is short for \"netcat\" and is similar to `cat` but works over\n",
    "network connections. It reads from standard input and writes its contents not\n",
    "to standard output, but to a specified server. \n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answers in the corresponding sections of `networking.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Point `nc` to google.com as follows: `nc www.google.com 80` When you first\n",
    "   connect, it will be silent. Then type any arbitrary text and press enter.\n",
    "   What is the error number?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Now type a valid http request into nc and press enter: `GET / HTTP/1.1`. What is the output?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Now use `nc` to make a server. In one window, type `nc -l 12345`. This\n",
    "   will cause `nc` to listen on port `12345`. In *another terminal* on the same\n",
    "   machine, type `nc localhost 12345`. You can type a message in one window\n",
    "   and it will appear in the other window (and vice versa). This trick can be\n",
    "   very useful to test basic internet connectivity - if the client and server\n",
    "   can send packets at all. *No answer* is required for this question.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. By convention, `roscore` listens on port `11311`. Try using `nc` to connect to\n",
    "   port `11311` on a machine where `roscore` is running, such as the your Duckiebot or Duckiedrone.\n",
    "   What protocol is `roscore` using to communicate (think application layer)?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Talking to Your Robot\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, this assignment has required access to `localhost`, the local machine\n",
    "you are connected to, and `google.com`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most commonly, the base station and robot are connected over TCP/IP to the same\n",
    "local network. Then you can look up your machine's IP address (`ifconfig` in\n",
    "Unix; other ways in other OSes), and your robot's IP address, and connect them.\n",
    "How can you find your robot's IP address? Well it's a chicken-and-egg problem.\n",
    "If you knew the IP address, you can connect to the robot and run `ifconfig` and\n",
    "find the IP address, but you don't know the IP address.\n",
    "\n",
    "What to do? There are several solutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Write the answers to the following questions in `networking.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Brainstorm how you can solve the chicken-and-egg program to connect to your robot. List three different solutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Look Ma, No Internet!\n",
    "\n",
    "But what about if there *is* no public internet connection? What if you want to use your robot in the wilderness? Well, there does exist cellular modems and\n",
    "satellite connections, but you can also tell your robot to act as a Wifi\n",
    "Hotspot. It can create a network and run a DHCP server. Then you can connect\n",
    "your laptop's base station using the SSID and passphrase specified in that\n",
    "file, and connect to the robot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively you can set up your laptop as the Wifi base station and configure\n",
    "the robot to connect to its network. The details will vary depending on your\n",
    "laptop OS and settings. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a Duckiedrone you can configure it to be a Wireless AP Master by default [(see here)](https://staging-docs.duckietown.com/daffy/opmanual-duckiedrone/drone-handling/first-connection.html). Connect to it with your base station. \n",
    "\n",
    "Write the answers to the following questions in `networking.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Which machine is acting as the DHCP server?\n",
    "2. What is the Duckiedrone's IP address? What is yours?\n",
    "3. Describe another network configuration for the wifi, other than the robot being a Wireless AP Master.  \n",
    "4. Describe three network configurations for a network allowing a basestation and robot to communicate with each other. Feel free to add additional devices, such as a cell phone performing internet connection sharing. \n"
