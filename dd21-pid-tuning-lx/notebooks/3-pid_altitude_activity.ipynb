    "# Part 1: Altitude PID in Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of the project, you will be implementing a PID controller for a simulated drone that can only move in one dimension, the vertical dimension. You can control the speed the motors spin on the drone, which sets the thrust being generated by the propellers. In this system, the process variable is the drone's altitude, the setpoint is the desired altitude, and the error is the distance in meters between the setpoint and the drone's altitude. The output of the control function is a [PWM (pulse-width modulation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation)\n",

    "You should implement the discretized version of the PID control function in <i>student_pid_class.py</i>:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$u(t) = K_pe(t_k) + K_i\\sum_{i=0}^k e(t_i)\\Delta t + K_d\\frac{e(t_k)-e(t_{k-1})}{\\Delta t} + K$$\n",

    "$$\\Delta t = Time \\; Elapsed \\; from \\; Previous \\; Iteration$$\n",

    "Notice that there is an extra offset term $K$ added to the control function. This is the base PWM value/throttle command before the three control terms are applied to correct the error in the system.\n",

    "  5. Implement the I term and observe the difference between PD and PID control. What role does the I term play in this system? What happens when $K_p$ and $K_d$ are set to zero?  \n",
    "  6. Implement the `reset` method and test its behavior. If implemented incorrectly, what problems can you anticipate reset causing?  \n",
    "  7. Finally, tune the constants in your PID controller to the best of your abilities. When the setpoint is moving, the drone should chase the setpoint very closely. When the setpoint is still, the drone should converge exactly at the setpoint and not oscillate. Report your tuning values.\n"
